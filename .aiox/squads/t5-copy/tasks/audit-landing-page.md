# Audit Landing Page Task

## Purpose

Comprehensive landing page audit combining Alex Hormozi's Value Equation, MECLABS Conversion Sequence Heuristic, StoryBrand Framework, and CXL best practices. Delivers actionable scorecard with prioritized fixes and A/B test recommendations.

## When to Use

- Landing page converting below industry benchmarks
- High traffic but low conversions
- Before scaling ad spend
- After offer or messaging changes
- A/B test planning and prioritization
- Launching new campaign or funnel
- Competitive analysis of competitor pages

## Framework Foundation

### MECLABS Conversion Sequence Heuristic

```
C = 4M + 3V + 2(i-f) - 2a

Where:
M = Motivation of user (×4 weight)
V = Value proposition clarity (×3 weight)
i = Incentive to act now (×2 weight)
f = Friction in the process (-×2 weight)
a = Anxiety about converting (-×2 weight)
```

### Alex Hormozi Value Equation

```
Value = (Dream Outcome × Perceived Likelihood) / (Time Delay × Effort Required)

Maximize: Dream Outcome, Likelihood
Minimize: Time Delay, Effort
```

### StoryBrand BrandScript

```
Character → Problem → Guide → Plan → Call to Action → Failure → Success
```
